# Useful notes

## why CLI?

CLIs are everywhere across different operating systems because they let you do a lot more with less hassle.

> Productivity: **Make repetitive tasks automatic with scripts**, **Do complex things quickly with simple commands**, **Move and change data between programs easily**, **Find, change, and organize files and programs without a lot of clicking**

> Control and Access: **Change system settings that you can't with just a mouse**, **Get direct access to the computer's files and resources**, **Build programs from their basic code**, **Find and fix problems in applications**

> Portable Skills: **Use what you know on Linux, macOS, and Windows**, **Work easily on both cloud servers and your own computer**, **Useful for many programming languages and tools**

> Coding and Deployment: **Fits right into how developers work**, **Tools for working with code, like Git, are used through the CLI**, **Set up and manage how software gets from development to use**, **Control how computers and servers run your software**

> Understanding Systems: **Learn what's happening inside the computer**, **Understand how different parts of computing work together**, **A base for learning more advanced tech stuff**

Getting good at CLI means developers can save time, be more flexible, and use advanced features no matter what computer or system they're on. It's a key skill for developers to have[^1].

## CLI vs GUI

|             CLI              |              GUI               |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| typing command, reading text | Pictures, windows, mouse/touch |
| Automate tasks, more control |       Easier for people        |

## what is shell

Think of the shell as the part of your computer that listens to what you type and tells your computer what to do. It's like a translator between you and your computer's operating system[^1].

### kernel?

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. It manages the following resources of the Linux system:

* File management
* Process management
* I/O management
* Memory management
* Device management etc.

Complete Linux system = Kernel + GNU system utilities and libraries + other management scripts + installation scripts[^4].

### pwd

> where you are in your computer [^1]

### ls

> Lists everything in your current folder[^1]

options: `-l` (more details), `-a` (include hidden files), `-t` (sort by time), `-h` (human readable format), `-ltah` (Union of all options)
